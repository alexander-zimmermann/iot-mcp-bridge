"""Rule-based detectors that JOIN `knx_1h` × `ga_catalog` to score per
room. Two UCs:

* ``fbh_cold`` — FBH valve open AND room stays below setpoint for >=2h.
  Stuck valve / bled circuit / sensor mismatch.
* ``window_while_heating`` — window open AND FBH heating AND it's cold
  outside. Comfort + energy-waste pattern.

Both insert into ``mcp_anomalies`` idempotently (one row per
``(time, source, metric, detector)``) and publish on
``anomaly.<uc>.<severity>`` only on new inserts.
