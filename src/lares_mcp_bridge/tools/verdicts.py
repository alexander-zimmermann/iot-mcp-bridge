"""The server's only write: a person's binary judgement on one subject.

A verdict says whether a thing was any good, and it is the one measurement
the platform does not give itself. On an episode it judges the detection —
was the fault real or nonsense — and it hangs on the individual episode
rather than on the fault, so it stays possible to see *when* a fault is
wrong: only at night, only in summer, only while the laundry runs. On a run
it judges the output — was the answer helpful or useless.

Binary by design in both cases: nobody sustains a richer scale, and for the
only questions that matter (how often does this fault get it wrong, how often
does this use case earn its tokens) it is enough. One verdict per subject; a
second thought overwrites the first instead of stacking beside it.

Nothing acts on a verdict. They are counted per fault and per use case on the
dashboard and thresholds are moved by a person with those numbers in view —
which is what turns tuning from an opinion into a measurement. Both writes go
through the separate write pool, whose role may touch the verdict table and
the two verdict columns of the ledger and nothing else.
